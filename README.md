# seismic_prediction
This very complicated machine learning project is for a kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/LANL-Earthquake-Prediction. The project is a combined application of complex feature engineering, ensemble learning of "xgboost", "lightgbm" and "catboost" and a parameter turning package "hyperopt".
Note that the main function is in seismic_prediction.py, and alot of settings are also there.
