# seismic_prediction
This very complicated machine learning project is based on a seismic dataset https://www.kaggle.com/c/LANL-Earthquake-Prediction. The project is a combined application of complex feature engineering of time series, ensemble learning of "xgboost", "lightgbm" and "catboost", and a parameter turning package "hyperopt".  
Note that the main function is in seismic_prediction.py, and a lot of settings are also there.
